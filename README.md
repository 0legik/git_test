It is my study about how work git with github as a repository

Just few words about git.

I have finished a course on www.codecademy.com that was about how to use git. I like it. 
But now I want to try use it practically with online resources like a this one. 
I'll be happy if all be worked very well.

I have found that "git clone" is not work on my PC. 
I created SSH key, but the problem not with it. Git responded me that there are not repository, that I wrote.
But clone via HTTPS works correctly.

And one more thing.

Third more thing.
